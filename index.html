            <h2>About Factorials</h2>
            <p>The factorial of a non-negative integer <em>n</em>, denoted by <em>n!</em>, is the product of all
                positive integers less than or equal to <em>n</em>. For example:</p>
            <p>5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120</p>
            <p>0! is defined to be 1.</p>
            <h3>Origin of Factorials</h3>
            <p>The concept of factorials originated from permutations and combinations in mathematics. The notation
                <em>n!</em> was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808.</p>
            <h3>Relation to the Gamma Function</h3>
            <p>The factorial function is closely related to the Gamma function, denoted by Γ(n). For positive integers,
                the Gamma function is defined as:</p>
            <p>Γ(n) = (n-1)!</p>
            <p>The Gamma function extends the factorial function to real and complex numbers, except for negative
                integers.</p>
            <h3>Factorial of Fractions and Negative Numbers</h3>
            <p>For non-integer values, the factorial function can be computed using the Gamma function. For example:</p>
            <p>Γ(1/2) = √π</p>
            <p>Therefore, (1/2)! = √π</p>
            <p>For negative numbers, the factorial is undefined, but the Gamma function can be used for non-integer
                negative values.</p>
            <h3>Applications of Factorials</h3>
            <p>Factorials have various applications in different fields of mathematics and science:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Combinatorics:</strong> Factorials are used to count the number of ways to arrange or select
                    items. For example, the number of ways to arrange <em>n</em> distinct items is <em>n!</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Probability:</strong> Factorials are used in probability theory to calculate permutations
                    and combinations, which are essential for determining the likelihood of events.</li>
                <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Factorials appear in the coefficients of binomial expansions, such as in
                    the binomial theorem.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculus:</strong> Factorials are used in the Taylor series expansion of functions, which is
                    a way to approximate functions with polynomials.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Factorials are used in algorithms and complexity analysis,
                    particularly in problems involving permutations and combinations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Research Related to Factorials</h3>
